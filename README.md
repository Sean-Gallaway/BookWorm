Bookworm Virtual Library
by Cole Ralph, Garrett Bassen, Kiyrah Keith, Sean Gallaway, and Stephen Nugent


The bookworm virtual library system by Worms Inc. is a purely-virtual ebook repository where users can browse and check out books. 
Users may create profiles which allows them to save their liked and disliked books list. 
All user data is safely and reliably stored in the cloud.

MEET THE TEAM: Garrett, Sean, Stephen, Kiyrah and Cole make up the Worm team. We are interested in creating the BookWorm virtual library system because it will allow us to design and 
create a practical, user-friendly application within a group environment. We will also gain practical experience with databases as well as github and other collaborative tools. 
Furthermore, we have multiple members that are avid readers which makes the creation process much more enjoyable.

LAYOUT FUNCTIONALITY, AND DESIGN
The Bookworm Virtual Library will consist of four primary pages. These pages will include the home page, search page, checkout page, and the profile page. 
Each page will be explained in greater detail within their respective subsection below.

Home Page: The home page will be the first page the user finds themselves on upon opening the application. It will consist of general book suggestions from popular genres and 
recent hits. The user may browse through these books and investigate further if they are interested. 

Search Page: The browse page will allow users to search for books across the virtual library. The page will include a search bar which will populate the screen with books when prompted.
	
Checkout Page: The checkout page will allow users to view books in their cart and wishlist, and users can check them out if copies are available.
	
Profile Page: The profile page contains user information and an overview of the user's profile. It also contains buttons that take the user to their settings.
