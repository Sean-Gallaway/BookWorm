One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them 
all and in the darkness bind them.

Sauron, the Dark Lord, has gathered to him all the Rings of Power—the 
means by which he intends to rule Middle-earth. All he lacks in his plans 
for dominion is the One Ring—the ring that rules them all—which has fallen 
into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins.

In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced 
with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his 
care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across 
Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the 
Dark Lord in his evil purpose.
