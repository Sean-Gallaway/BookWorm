One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them 
all and in the darkness bind them.

As the shadow of Mordor grows across the land, the Companions of the Ring 
have become involved in separate adventures. Aragorn, revealed as the 
hidden heir of the ancient Kings of the West, has joined with the Riders 
of Rohan against the forces of Isengard and takes part in the desperate 
battle of the Hornburg. Merry and Pippin, captured by Orcs, escape into 
Fangorn Forest and there encounter the Ents.

Gandalf has miraculously returned and defeated the evil wizard, Saruman. 
Sam has left his master for dead after a battle with the giant spider, 
Shelob; but Frodo is still aliveâ€”now in the foul hands of the Orcs.

Meanwhile, the armies of the Dark Lord are massing as the One Ring draws 
ever nearer to the Cracks of Doom.
