"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit." So begins one of the most 
beloved and delightful tales in the English language—Tolkien's prelude to 
The Lord of the Rings. Set in the imaginary world of Middle-earth, at once 
a classic myth and a modern fairy tale, The Hobbit is one of literature's 
most enduring and well-loved novels.

Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable, unambitious life, 
rarely traveling any farther than his pantry or cellar. But his 
contentment is disturbed when the wizard Gandalf and a company of dwarves 
arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an adventure. They 
have launched a plot to raid the treasure hoard guarded by Smaug the 
Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon. Bilbo reluctantly joins 
their quest, unaware that on his journey to the Lonely Mountain he will 
encounter both a magic ring and a frightening creature known as Gollum.
