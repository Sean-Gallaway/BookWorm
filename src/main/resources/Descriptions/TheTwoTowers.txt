Frodo and his Companions of the Ring have been beset by danger during 
their quest to prevent the Ruling Ring from falling into the hands of the 
Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost the 
wizard, Gandalf, in a battle in the Mines of Moria. And Boromir, seduced 
by the power of the Ring, tried to seize it by force. While Frodo and Sam 
made their escape, the rest of the company was attacked by Orcs. Now they 
continue the journey alone down the great River Anduinâ€”alone, that is, 
save for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go.
