Narnia . . . a land frozen in eternal winter . . . a country waiting to be 
set free

Witness the creation of a magical land in The Magician's Nephew, the first 
title in C. S. Lewis's classic fantasy series, which has captivated 
readers of all ages for over sixty years. This rack-size paperback 
features cover art by Cliff Nielsen and black-and-white interior artwork 
by the original illustrator of Narnia, Pauline Baynes.

On a daring quest to save a life, two friends are hurled into another 
world, where an evil sorceress seeks to enslave them. But then the lion 
Aslan's song weaves itself into the fabric of a new land, a land that will 
be known as Narnia. And in Narnia, all things are possible.

This is a stand-alone novel, but if you want to journey back to Narnia, 
read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the second book in The 
Chronicles of Narnia.
